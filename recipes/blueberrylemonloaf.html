    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A family recipe for our favorite blueberry lemon bread. No mixer required! Like most sweet loaves, it tastes best when allowed to sit for a day, wrapped in plastic wrap.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon confectioners' sugar</li>
        <li>¾ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup melted butter</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup sour cream</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 ⅔ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups frozen blueberries</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Grate the zest from the lemon onto a small plate. Cut the lemon in half, and squeeze the juice from both halves. Make a topping by whisking together 1 teaspoon of the lemon zest, 1 tablespoon of the lemon juice, and the confectioners' sugar in a small bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together the white sugar, melted butter, eggs, sour cream, the remaining lemon zest, and the remaining lemon juice in a large bowl until evenly blended. Stir in the milk; set aside.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt in a separate large bowl. Remove 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture and set aside. Make a well in the center of the flour mixture; pour the milk mixture into the well and stir the batter just until combined.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Fold the frozen blueberries into the reserved 3 tablespoons of the flour mixture, then fold the blueberries into the batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 60 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Remove from oven; immediately poke holes all over the top of the loaf with a toothpick, and pour the topping evenly over the loaf. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
