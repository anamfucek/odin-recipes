    <h2 class="caramel">Description</h2>
    <p class="caramel">Caramel macchiato banana bread features a coffee-infused loaf and a rich caramel glaze. Baking banana bread is one of my favorite things to do. I love nothing more than enjoying a slice with a nice cup of coffee — that’s what inspired this recipe!</p>
    <br>
    <br>
     <h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul> 
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 large very ripe bananas</li>
        <li>½ cup caramel macchiato-flavored liquid coffee creamer (such as International Delight) </li>
        <li>⅔ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>½ cup vegetable oil</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons instant coffee granules</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
     </ul>
     <br>
     <br>
     <h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Whisk flour, baking soda, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt together in a bowl.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Mash bananas in a large mixing bowl with a fork until almost smooth. Stir in coffee creamer, sugar, oil, eggs, and instant coffee granules until coffee granules have dissolved. Gradually stir in flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, until batter is almost smooth. Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the loaf comes out clean, about 1 hour. Allow to cool before removing from pan, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>While the bread is cooling, melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Mix in brown sugar and vanilla and bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve sugar. Reduce the heat and simmer syrup for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat and let cool to a warm but liquid temperature.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Pour glaze over cooled banana bread. Serve when glaze has set.</li>
     </ol>
